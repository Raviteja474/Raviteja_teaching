What you are going to suspect in rerun?
______________________________________________________
Intention of rerun: To ensure the consistancy of the failure

Run : test 1  , test 2(some operations on drive), failed TC3

Fresh fw flash

TC3 pass: individual run

Previous tests may corrupt the drive

Eg:
Test 2 : Freeze firmware --> Unfreeze we must do
Test 3: Update firmware

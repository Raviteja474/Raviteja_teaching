how can we identify the available machines using request module by get() method

1. NMAP  --> It will give All machines in which MSVP port is enabled

command: link
for ip in ips:
    ip  port-starting(single) port-ending

2. API  Generation -->  return dict   --> json
return JSON

input: json file
3. request --> output: dict
{"107.99.42.18":["windows","administrator":"win123"],"107.99.42.53":["Azure","administrator":"azure123"]}

.exe file how we run in multiple pc's (how we are going to mention the specific testcases to run in specified machines)


do you worked with QTest in python
QTest  -->   pytest+jenkins(CICD)
open source

Avinash: Explore
1. Single test
2. pycharm parameters , command line arguments
__________________________________________________________________________________________
what is rerun

Fail, u want to make sure issue is consistent(reproduce)
1. Device enumeration drop
2. Network latencies
3. Previous test might affect present test

U will run this test in isolation

Regression

Driver  5.0.0
Test suite 5.0.0
firmware 5.0.0   Fail

step:1

Driver  4.9.0
Test suite 5.0.0
firmware 5.0.0   pass: MSVP driver issue


Driver  5.0.0
Test suite 4.9.0
firmware 5.0.0  pass: MSVP validation team issue

Driver  5.0.0
Test suite 5.0.0
firmware 4.9.0  pass: MSVP firmware issue

does the msv is seperate application/framework

Chrome Application/software

Framework: How many members are in india
excel FB(100 usernames, 100 password), selenium , chrome, value inspect, python count

Framework: programming language+ Application+ environment
MSVP framework: Driver+Test suite+ Application

how can we link python and MSV framework

if test cases are written in c,c++, do you execute the testcases in different server

No, Validation team used to write testcases in c++ previously.

1. We don't have remote servers , we have only test PCs

Remote server:  IRCRTC ticket, which computer processed your ticket? which computer presently store your ticket details?
Load balancing: 1000 servers, 10,00,000
purpose: These are intended for high traffic.

Protocol Validation
U know IP, U device, same server.

you are working with storage right, can you tell me what kind of work do with the storage

1. We won't work on Storage validation scripts
2. We will do Framework Automation
3. We will help validation team to run their scripts in conval

how can you say that tuple of list is efficient
[1,2]
([1,2])-->

1. Tuple:
more readable and less writable
when there are scope for changes then it will less memory efficient.
2.list
more writable and lesser readable
extra buffer-72b

>>> import sys
>>> sys.getsizeof(tuple(iter(range(10))))
128
>>> sys.getsizeof(list(iter(range(10))))
200

--> When u don't want to change a particular data structure and want to use it frequently

what is namespace in python and why we use it
py1  list_1

py2  list_1

list_1

py1.list_1; without conflicts you want to access variables

to solve conflict variable names;  then the scope will define which variable it is according to LEGB

namespaces = unique name

in slicing we are using negative index or -1 in python, why do we use that

I am indian, I love my country$
25 len , 24 last --> based on length
-1 --> last variable

[1,2,4,6,7,8,9,11,42]

method:1 len()= 9, print(ele:8)
method:2 print(ele:-1)

python has specifiers/access specifiers, any example

access specifiers: protected , public , private

there is garbage collection in python, can you explain how it works

reference count
manual manual garbage collection

dealloaction: =None, del

allocation =1003, deallocations =2, threshold =1000
1003-2>1000; GC will trigger

import gc
When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations is greater than the threshold number,
the garbage collector is run.

have you used pytest, you are having experience in pytest framework, what are
basic rules to write the testcases for pytest framework

pytest commands explain
subtest:

Explain all command signratures

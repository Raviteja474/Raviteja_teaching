2. how to install python and MSV on the host's pc"s?

python  --> winrm

Python is not recognized as an internal or external command

MSV  --> It present in every system (nmap will only filter which machines have MSV)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3. flashing or validation test which one is done first?

you are validating your test cases on particular firmware

firmware flashing --> validation tests run on particular firmware

firmware flashing and config files will be flashed automatically when we copied to test PC MSVP_lanuch folder.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4. How Firmware flashing and config are done?

firmware flashing and config files will be flashed automatically when we copied to test PC MSVP_launch folder.

Automatically these will be flashed using .bat file.
1. firmware.bin --> flashing
2. config.json --> flashing

Testsuite.exe  --> installation
How to install a python application using winrm ????

launch.json  stating:1500 ending:1550

5. Eagle, Elan, Epic are products it will be the same for both SSD and HDD?

        SSD         HDD
Epic   iphone 7s, note 4
Eagle  iphone 8s, noted 5
Elan   iphone 9s, noted 6

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6. which data structure are used in our project?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7. how code is written in python to execute the subtests in pytest suite and
how u r making sure how many tests failed to make sure stabilized envirnonment?

Subtests are only for MSV stability purposes?  YES


pytest 6 subtests

write python script that will run a stability file, if none of the tests fail, it should print 1 to 100........

environment_stability_1.py   2 tests fail and 3 tests pass

environment_stability_2.py  5 tests pass

print 1 to 100

"pytest environment_stability_1.py -v"  --> FAIL --> print test failed...

"pytest environment_stability_1.py -v"  --> FAIL not found --> print 1 to 100....


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

8. how do we get firmware and config files?

Network shared path, we will copy from there
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9. what is the process that should be done in python scripting and MSV framework automation?

MSVP automation framework is developed using python language.

MSVP framework(Driver) -->  when u say to write to fullest possible capacity

MSVP framework is a driver, normally driver is interface between a hardware and software
Eg: audio drivers(vlc media --> audio driver --> speakers)
eg:2 MSVP driver(python software(validation tests)--> MSVPdriver --> operations performed on SSD.)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

10. If there is a loss of data packs you stop the process or will you continue or recheck?

stop the process

FAIL--> pass --> fail; unqualify it

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

11. How do you configure Pytest and how do you run test cases, for example, if you are having 15 test cases how will you
prioritize those test cases?


pytest priority

TC1, TC2, TC3, TC4  --> TC3, TC1, TC2, TC4

We will follow only sequential order, there is no prioritization

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

12. Have you worked on any virtualization like VMware, VFXI?

NO
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

13. what is the difference between abstract class and interface?

There is no interface in python

Java:
Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Interface can have only abstract methods.

python:
Unfortunately, Python doesn't have interfaces, or at least,
not quite built into the language. Enter Python's abstract base class, or, cutely, ABC.
Functionally, abstract base classes let you define a class with abstract methods,
which all subclasses must implement in order to be initialized.

14. How do you share the report with the client?

last step -->  upload the excel file to conval dashboard where clients/customers can see.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

15. Have you worked on CICD?

No, CICD is jenkins based application.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
16. Did you work on any framework tools?

Framework tool:

Client framework: QTest, MSV
tools: Raritan, Postman

Raritan: configuration
It will fetch all smart parameters avaialable for every machine.
you can restart machine, u can access machine in boot mode itself.
Refresh cycle 5 mins to avoid overheads.
master(command send)-slave(command slave).

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
17. Are you doing automation from the scratch and are you using any tool?

From scratch
Everything is python script, we are not using any drag and drop framework
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

18. I have 10 devices connected in the suites ok, I give you the IP addresses, and by matching the IP's you need to fetch
them using Regex or any other way to achieve this without using Regex?

10 devices, 10 systems

107.99.42.01

test logs --> device information

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

19. which tool you are using for backlogs and stories?

stories = Development tickets
enhancements = bug fixes,defect
backlogs = spill over tickets from the sprint

splunk = log inspection
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


20.what is the difference between inheritance and composition?

class A:
    def method1():
        print("I am methoda")

class B(A):
    def method2():
        print("I am methodb")

b= B()
# by inheriting
b.method1()



Thus, when one needs to use the class as it without any modification, the composition is recommended and when one needs
to change the behavior of the method in another class, then inheritance is recommended.


class A:
    def method1():
        print("I am methoda")

class B:
    def method2():
        print("I am methodb")

a= A()
# composition
a.method1()

21. Have you tested any rest API/ web services?

DRF = Django Rest API

soap api = SOAPUI
Rest API = postman

we have micron internal webserives or API and that is deployed as service and we are using request moule to consume an API
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
22. while executing the test cases you will have some errors, how will you conclude that the issue is from the internal
framework or target application?

1.no logs --> framework issue
MSVP application crash

pre condition/post condition--> issues ; log based(in TestPC)
conval process based --> local logs(trigger machine logs)

target application = banking (remote servers)
target device = SSD/HDD(secure lab server)

23. what are the basic things we need to take care of when we write a unit test using Pytest?

test_*
_test

subtest
test_

Total pytest commands explanation

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
24. can I run the command in remote machine using paramiko and can I know the files present in remote machine using
paramiko?

paramiko SFTP

corner case:
Already existing name, same file trying copy  -->

winrm --> cd directory & dir
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

25. How will you communicate one process to another process using subprocess and what is the purpose of subprocess module
 and it only to run the command in local machine or even in the remote machine?

# 19@@@ STDIN

 local machine

 stdin =

26. How much do you have experience with networking, you know L2, L3 protocols anything?

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


27. when your folder becomes a package?

__init__.py

The package folder contains a special file called __init__.py , which stores the package's content. It serves two purposes:
The Python interpreter recognizes a folder as the package if it contains __init__.py file. __init__.py exposes specified
resources from its modules to be imported.

28. what is the API calling function  you used?

request.get(API_URL)


19@@ post, put
Flask changes GET/POST
postman

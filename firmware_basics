ROM Non volatile memory = with our data pesisits
Intel SSD validation
Nvme 1.4 spec , pcie spec

work:
Firmware Engineer after he develop the firmware, validation engineers will follow above specs and write testcases and
validate the features.

Connect SSD to gender card in linux machine and give commands in nmcli console.

writeFirmware() = firmware will flash to RAM
commitFirmware() = RAM to device
restart() = Firmware will activate

writeconfig() = writing configuration values of OEM

drive = Nand logic logic , Ic are interconnected
IC = integrated logic,
Each capacitor store one bit of data

2 TB, 4 Tb, 8 Tb, 16 Tb
Sata?? No
Nvme yes

Script:
Testcase fail, dump generate(pcie live dump), assert code print
Each error in firmware will have unique number, that is called assert code.

Layers:

host --> device
OS --> pcie registers --> controller  --> Nand flash

command processing:
64k queue
submission queue  --> controller  --> completion queue

purpose:
python coverage is used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.


commands:	

	run – Run a Python program and collect execution data.

	combine – Combine together a number of data files.

	erase – Erase previously collected coverage data.

	report – Report coverage results.

	html – Produce annotated HTML listings with coverage results.

	xml – Produce an XML report with coverage results.

	json – Produce a JSON report with coverage results.

	lcov – Produce an LCOV report with coverage results.

	annotate – Annotate source files with coverage results.

	debug – Get diagnostic information.



Example:

def sum(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2


def sum_only_positive(num1, num2):
    if num1 > 0 and num2 > 0:
        return num1 + num2
    else:
        return None
		
test.py#python file
		
from first import sum, sum_only_positive

def test_sum():
    assert sum(5, 5) == 10

def test_sum_positive_ok():
    assert sum_only_positive(2, 2) == 4

def test_sum_positive_fail():
    assert sum_only_positive(-1, 2) is None

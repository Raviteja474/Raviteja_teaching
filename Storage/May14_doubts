How to Analyze & ways to approach the assigned JIRA/issue (JIRA comment structure)(based on the previous comments in the
JIRA how we are going to check)

Bharath Assert statements

Intial triage:
What is the test suite, subtest name
what is impact statement line number
LS, firmware

1. Try to reproduce(same capability, preferably same capacity)
2. Test run history(This product, last pass?)
3. Is there any script fix happened between last pass and today?
    a. If yes, use old code check
4. Check with previously passed firmware with latest fix?
5. What is the TWIDL version between today and last pass?

binary= build= NFR= Fw = bin
why? It will describe how SSD should work
Lightswitch = config file = xml file
why? It will write customer specific tokens
LS: customer, capacity?

test plan --> yml


Drive Preperation: on TWIDL
1. Bootloader
2. Firmware flash
3. Light switch

1 TB Generic Fw load:
1. Bootloader info
2. WW20.3, Generic firmware, assert/EI/production
3. customer, capacity?

9.6 TB, Dell, Error injection
WW20.3 Dell Fw location
 1. Bootloader file, wspi()
 2. WW20.3 EI build ,
    SATA -->wfw,cfw,warmReset
    NVMe -> firmwareDownloadActivate(AA=3,FS=1)
   3. Lightswitch location
    9.6 TB, Dell LS -->writeFConfig()

getSSD()
ssd=devobj()
ssd.unlock()
ssd.wfw(r'y:/ww20.3/DVAA12.bin')
ssd.cfw()
ssd.warmReset()
getSSD()


llf- low level format
edump- erase dump
cdm - create defect map



Why we are using failed log command file in the client machine to run the test in FAST(cmd file.retry)

retry --> cmd
FAST --> run a test
        run a template


By using TWIDL, what we are checking the commands manually, is there any standard commands, or based upon the requirement
 are we using them
(wfw(),cfw(),warmReset() in which scenarios we are using them)

Do we need to check the code manually in TWIDL, using any print statements?
print
4 spaces

In the client machine after changing the command file data how do we need to give the relevant tag name?
NSGSE-212346_run_1
NSGSE-212346_run_2_7.6TB
NSGSE-212346_run_3_3.8TB
NSGSE-212346_run_4_3.8TB_pita


How the test severity is categorized like NRT, NRT0, NRT1, XFT --> refer wiki

 severity -->       NRT0  NRT  XFT  --> vv high, high, medium
  time -->          NRT0  NRT  XFT  --> medium, high, vv high,

What are FW and driver and how they will communicate?
Fw  --> drive non-volatile memory
Drive = SSD
Driver = TWIDL
OS will communicate via driver with drive FW.

What are a Mule drive and a normal drive?

What is sandbox release? --> almost stabilized products
Intel --> YVRR
YVRR_CE  --> sandbox branch
master --> Dev is under progress

What is a light switch (LS)
An xml file will have a set of tokens intended for particulat customer and sku(size)

What is FW path, old binary, and new binary paths, and how can we check them?
old_binary:  ww14 ; lower revision
new_binary:  WW15 ; higher revision













HDD --> moving part, durability issues, Read/write speed low


SSD --> Solid state Device
CTF = Charge Trapped flash

SATA, NVMe,PCie , SCSI

OF

Programmed /written
non-programmed/ empty

1.6 TB = 1.6 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 8 = .. bits = .. transistors

1 MB = 10^3 KB =1000 KB
1 MiB = 1024 = 1024 KB

NAND flash < NOR flash

Process:
Pre silicon
Design validation(DV)
post silicon
product validation(PV)
spec validation

NVMe spec:  NVM Express Workgroup
Intel
Samsung
Micron
Sk hynix
WD
Seagate

C++
python

Performance testing : IOmeter, FIO, Medussa

Firmware flashing(installing), data integrity

Performance(XFT)
